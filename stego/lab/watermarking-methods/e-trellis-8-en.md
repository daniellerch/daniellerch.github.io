## Embedding

This method is based on System 5 presented in  [ [1](#references) ]. 
It is a similar based method to [E-Simple-8](/stego/lab/watermarking-methods/e-simple-8-en/), 
in the sense that 8 different marks are embedded in order to hide 8 bits. 
However, in this case Trellis codes are used to encode the bits, 
which allows for a much more reliable decoding.

It is a **robust** method, i.e. able to withstand some image alterations.

The code for the embedding method is available at the following link:
<a href='https://github.com/daniellerch/stegolab/tree/master/watermarking/E_TRELLIS_8.py'>E_TRELLIS_8</a>.

To embed a mark, just run a command like the following:

```bash
$ python3 E_TRELLIS_8.py image.png passw123 10101010 marked.png
```

## Detection

Mark detection and decoding is performed by calculating the 
**linear correlation** between the marked image and each of the eight marks.

The formula used for the linear correlation is as follows:

$Z_{lc} = \frac{1}{N} \bar{c} Â· \bar{w_r} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{xy}c(x,y) w_r(x,y)$

The [Viterbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm) 
algorithm is used for message decoding.


The code of the detection method is available at the following link: 
<a href='https://github.com/daniellerch/stegolab/tree/master/watermarking/D_TRELLIS_8.py'>D_TRELLIS_8</a>.

To detect the mark and see if a 0 or a 1 has been embedded, just run a command like the following:

```bash
$ python3 D_TRELLIS_8.py marked.png passw123
msg: 10101010
```
