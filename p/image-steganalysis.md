Here you can find an stegoanalysis of popular image steganography tools that you can find in the Internet. The purpose of this page is to provide a comparative study performed with state of the art techniques so that the user knows which tools are safe and which are not.

The steganography tools are separated in two groups. The first group uses techniques for embedding information that can be broken using old statistical attacks or that contain some important error that makes them detectable. These tools are not included in the final comparison table. These tools are:

- [Hide and Seek](#hide-and-seek)
- [OpenStego](#openstego)

The second group contains tools that use more advanced techniques and that are difficult to detect. In this case we use machine learning based attacks. This allows us to compare which of these techinques is more difficult to detect in laboratory conditions, but it does not allow us to ensure that these tools can be detected reliably in the real world. These tools are:

- [OpenPuff](#openpuff)
- [StegHide](#steghide)
<br>



I maintain this list to be updated about the status of the tools available and the level of security they provide. If you know another tool that should be in the list, please let [me](http://daniellerch.me) know. 

The analysis of the tools was performed using [Aletheia](https://github.com/daniellerch/aletheia).

#### OpenStego

[OpenStego](https://www.openstego.com/) is a Java tool for hiding information in the spatial domain (steganography and watermarking). At the moment of writing these lines the las version available is v0.7.3.

With a simple experiment we can see that the method used for embedding is LSB replacement. That is, we hide the bits of the message by replacing the least significant bit (LSB) of the pixel. Actually, the tool supports using several pixels per channel, but this is even more detectable.

First we download a copy of the Lena image, then we prepare a file with some secret data and finally we hide the message:

```bash
$ wget {{ site.baseurl }}/images/lena.png
$ head -500 /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 > secret.txt
$ openstego embed -mf secret.txt -cf lena.png -sf stego.png
```

With Aletheia we can check the modifications performed by OpenStego in the stego image:


```bash
$ ./aletheia.py print-diffs lena.png stego.png

Channel 1:
[(226, 227, 1), (223, 222, -1), (221, 220, -1), (223, 222, -1)]
[(229, 228, -1), (234, 235, 1), (174, 175, 1), (180, 181, 1)]
[(190, 191, 1), (204, 205, 1), (202, 203, 1), (204, 205, 1)]
[(210, 211, 1), (208, 209, 1), (207, 206, -1), (204, 205, 1)]
...


Channel 2:                                                                                                                            
[(226, 227, 1), (223, 222, -1), (221, 220, -1), (223, 222, -1)] 
[(229, 228, -1), (234, 235, 1), (174, 175, 1), (180, 181, 1)]
[(190, 191, 1), (204, 205, 1), (202, 203, 1), (204, 205, 1)]
[(210, 211, 1), (208, 209, 1), (207, 206, -1), (204, 205, 1)]
...

Channel 3:                                                                                                                            
[(226, 227, 1), (223, 222, -1), (221, 220, -1), (223, 222, -1)]
[(229, 228, -1), (234, 235, 1), (174, 175, 1), (180, 181, 1)]
[(190, 191, 1), (204, 205, 1), (202, 203, 1), (204, 205, 1)]
[(210, 211, 1), (208, 209, 1), (207, 206, -1), (204, 205, 1)]
...
```

As you can see in the results, when a pixel of the cover image is even the performed operation is +1 and when a pixel of the cover image is odd the performed operation is -1. This is what happens when the embedding operation is LSB replacement. This anomaly has been exploited by several attacks [1, 2, 3](#references).

Let's try a RS attack:

```bash
$ ./aletheia.py rs stego.png 
Hiden data found in channel R 0.25
Hiden data found in channel G 0.24
Hiden data found in channel B 0.27
```

Let's try now with less data:

```bash
$ head -100 /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 > secret.txt
$ openstego embed -mf secret.txt -cf lena.png -sf stego.png
$ ./aletheia.py rs stego.png 
Hiden data found in channel R 0.06
Hiden data found in channel G 0.06
Hiden data found in channel B 0.07
```

Obviously, with the original Lena image, the tool does not detect any hidden data:

```bash
$ ./aletheia.py rs lena.png 
No hiden data found
```
