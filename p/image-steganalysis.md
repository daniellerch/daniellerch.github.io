Here you can find an stegoanalysis of popular image steganography tools that you can find in the Internet.The purpose of this page is to provide a comparative study performed with the state of the art techniques
so that the user knows which tools are safe and which are not.

I have separated the steganography tools in two groups. The first group uses techniques for embedding information that can be broken using old statistical attacks. These tools are:


- [OpenStego](#openstego)
- [OpenStego](#openstego)


The analysis was performed using [https://github.com/daniellerch/aletheia](Aletheia).

#### 1. Results


Firs I present the results obtained with the different attacks performed. In this way the reader who does not want to dig deeper can get a quick look. Later, I present the details of the experiments for each of the tools steganalyzed.
