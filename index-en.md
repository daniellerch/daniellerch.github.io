Hello and welcome to my page. My name is Daniel Lerch and this is a personal site
mainly dedicated to **steganography**, the ancient art and science of hidden communication.

   "Demaratus, the son of Ariston, who was an exile in Persia, (...) as soon as 
    news reached him at Susa that Xerxes had decided uponthe invasion of Greece, 
    he felt that he must pass on the information to Sparta. As the danger of 
    discovery was great, there was only one way in which he could contrive to get 
    the message through: this was by scraping the wax off a pair of wooden folding
    tablets, writing on the wood underneath what Xerxes intended to do, and then 
    covering the message over with wax again. In this way the tablets, being 
    apparently blank, would cause no trouble with the guards along the road."

   "[...] I have uncovered certain ways, both numerous and varied, that are 
    not to be entirely spurned whereby I can intimate my most secret thoughts 
    to another who knows this art, however far away I wish, securely and free 
    from the deceit, suspicion, or detection by anyone, using writing or openly 
    through messengers."

   "Histiaeus of Miletus shaved the head of a slave and tattooed a message onto 
    the man's head. After the slave's hair grew back, Histiaeus sent him to the 
    Greeks, who shaved the slave's head and read the secret message.

   "Two accomplices in a crime have been arrested and are about to be locked in 
    widely separated cells. Their only means of communication after they are 
    locked up will be by way of messages conveyed for them by trustees -- who 
    are known to be agents of the warden. (...). The prisoners, (...) are 
    willing to accept these conditions (...) to be able to communicate at all, 
    since they need to coordinate their plans. To do this they will have to 
    deceive the  warden by finding a way of communicating secretly (...)"
