Hello and welcome to my page. My name is Daniel Lerch and this is a personal site
mainly dedicated to **steganography**, the ancient art and science of hidden communication.



> "[...] I have uncovered certain ways, both numerous and varied, that are not to be entirely spurned whereby I can intimate my most secret thoughts to another who knows this art, however far away I wish, securely and free from the deceit, suspicion, or detection by anyone, using writing or openly through messengers."

- **[Aletheia]()**: Aletheia is an open source image steganalysis tool for the detection of hidden messages in images. To achieve its objectives, Aletheia uses state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. It is capable of detecting different steganographic methods as for example LSB replacement, LSB matching and some kind of adaptive schemes.

- **[Stego Retweet](https://github.com/daniellerch/stego-retweet)**: A tool for hiding messages in Twitter using retweets. Using a list of hashtags provided by the user, this tool finds and retweets some tweets containing especial words. This allows to hide a message that can be read by the user who has the password. The capacity is of two characters per retweet.
