- **[Aletheia](https://github.com/daniellerch/aletheia)**: Aletheia is an open source image steganalysis tool for the detection of hidden messages in images. To achieve its objectives, Aletheia uses state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. It is capable of detecting several different steganographic methods as for example F5, Steghide, LSB replacement, LSB matching and some kind of adaptive schemes.

- **[Python JPEG Toolbox](https://github.com/daniellerch/python-jpeg-toolbox)**: Toolbox for accessing low level JPEG information (DCT coefficients, quantization tables, ...) with Python. Its interface is similar to the well-known Matlab JPEG Toolbox. 

- **[Stego Retweet](https://github.com/daniellerch/stego-retweet)**: A tool for hiding messages in Twitter using retweets. Using a list of hashtags provided by the user, this tool finds and retweets some tweets containing especial words. This allows to hide a message that can be read by the user who has the password. The capacity is of two characters per retweet.
