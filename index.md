Hello and welcome to my page. My name is Daniel Lerch and this is a personal site
mainly dedicated to **steganography**, the ancient art and science of hidden communication.


> "Two accomplices in a crime have been arrested and are about to be locked in widely separated cells. Their only means of communication after they are locked up will be by way of messages conveyed for them by trustees -- who are known to be agents of the warden. (...). The prisoners, (...) are willing to accept these conditions (...) to be able to communicate at all, since they need to coordinate their plans. To do this they will have to deceive the  warden by finding a way of communicating secretly (...)"

### Latest updates

- **[Aletheia](https://github.com/daniellerch/aletheia)**: Aletheia is an open source image steganalysis tool for the detection of hidden messages in images. To achieve its objectives, Aletheia uses state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. It is capable of detecting different steganographic methods as for example LSB replacement, LSB matching and some kind of adaptive schemes.
